Websites for non-jerks
=======================

v0.48a - This guide will eventually be made into a website.

A guide for friendly websites (accessible, performant, progressively enhanced, and portable device happy).

The project aim is to have happier, educated teams and better quality websites and apps.

These are resources and tools that I think are excellent and add value to how we approach what we make. This is designed to be an argument buster and responsible decision primer for websites - with links to where I got the data, ideas, or followed a discussion.
